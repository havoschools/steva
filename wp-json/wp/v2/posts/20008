It has been an experience in watching them change throughout this semester. Friendships is always a tricky path to travel along especially when they are still trying to work out who they are and living with each other 24\/7. However, in saying this it wonderful to see how they young ladies have matured and are starting to use some of the skills they have learned during their PCP sessions at school.<\/p>\n<p>We celebrated Christmas as a boarding family and all the young ladies received a small gift from Mrs Clause. The dining room was decorated all things Christmas and the meal prepared by Chief Clare was a traditional Christmas dinner with ham, turkey, pavlova, trifle, jelly ice-cream and of course lollies. The evening was full of laughter and yes, I am sorry to say sugar. Some of the young ladies took a little longer to settle that evening. It reminded me of when my two daughters were growing up and how they would be so hyped up after a good Christmas meal (mainly lollies).<\/p>\n<p>[easy-image-collage id=20022]<\/p>\n<p>The Boarding mums have been doing a fantastic job in helping the ladies pack up their rooms. It is amazing how much one can gather over the year. Some parents I am sure may have needed a trailer to take everything home. We did open Teresa House where the girls were able to store some of their items.<\/p>\n<p>The young ladies had their final Recreational activities for 2022. These included a drive and walk through the city looking at the Christmas lights, the Sand castle building workshop as well as a movie night on the greens (sloped grass between the houses). Another eventful experience for all who participated.<\/p>\n<p>[easy-image-collage id=20023]<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>2022 has come to an end for all the young ladies at boarding.
