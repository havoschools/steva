The LifeLink Day Forum is an opportunity for students attending Catholic schools within the Archdiocese of Perth to join together to learn about how the Church\u2019s social service agencies reach out to provide practical care and direct assistance to thousands of people in need each year.<\/p>\n<p>This year LifeLink Day 2023 will be launched on <strong>Wednesday 7 June 2023<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>LifeLink Day provides a wonderful opportunity for students attending Catholic schools within the Archdiocese of Perth to join together to show their support for the Church\u2019s social service agencies \u2013 agencies which on behalf of us all, reach out to provide practical care and direct assistance to thousands of people in need each year.<\/p>\n<p>A key takeaway from the day was in the words of the Archbishop that at the heart LifLink is an appeal to all to support those in need and it is us living our Christian faith as we listen to the needs and do our part.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>\u201cI hear but I forget, but when I see I remember, and when I do I understand.\u201d<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Our Head of Faith and Mission, Mr Adrian Martino, recently sent out communication to our school community on our Term 2 LifeLink Day activities:<\/p>\n<p>Each year in Term 2, our fundraising efforts assist LifeLink Catholic Caring Agencies within the Archdiocese of Perth. This year we are holding two concurrent events:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Winter Appeal<\/strong> \u2014 Weeks 3 &#8211; 5. Each family is asked to bring to school, non- perishable cans, goods and donations (see attached list of suggested items) that will assist \u2018The Shopfront\u2019, a LifeLink Agency supporting needy families in the Archdiocese of Perth.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>St Pat\u2019s Community Support Centre, who we have supported with donations in the past, have also requested support from us as they are experiencing even greater need than usual for this time of year.<\/p>\n<p>Each House will create a &#8216;hamper stack&#8217; in Student Reception with their donated goods. House points to be awarded according to the amount donated by each House. Donated goods will then be sent to The Shopfront &amp; St Pat\u2019s Community Support Centre.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Gold Coin Challenge<\/strong> \u2014 later this term the Young Mercies for Vinnies group will organise an event requiring a gold coin donation from each student (details to follow).
