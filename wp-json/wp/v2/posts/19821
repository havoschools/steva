But this did not last long as we moved on to the final Year Twelves celebrations starting with the traditional boater throw (I have to say this tradition is becoming bigger and bigger every year) choreographed by the year 12 dance students. It was here they moved to their final assembly and another tradition of the eldest students receiving a token from the youngest students before performing the Year they graduate on the oval. The last two days are packed for our year 12s; however, they cap it off with their graduation dinner and awards nights. The young ladies enjoyed the final celebrations, and now some are sitting their ATAR exams while others have joined the workforce full-time. We wish the class of 2022 all the best with this next chapter, and may they keep living their life like Catherine McAuley.<\/p>\n<p>[easy-image-collage id=19826]<\/p>\n<p>Things did not quiet down once the twelves left as we moved straight on to celebrate students who achieved high results and special awards at Presentation night for years 7 -11. On the night, we were lucky to have the choir perform, and the dancers, including the Blaze dancers, showed all present what they had been learning throughout the evening.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>[easy-image-collage id=19830]<\/p>\n<p>The Year Nines had their final social with Mazenod. This was an evening on the Kalamunda Bowling Greens. The young students created teams and sent half the evening bowling and the other half playing games eating and cheering the lawn bowlers on.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>[easy-image-collage id=19834]<\/p>\n<p>SchoolTv special report is \u2018<strong>A Guide to Safe Partying.\u2019<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Celebrations, partying and socialising are a fundamental rite of passage and one of the most important aspects of a young person\u2019s life. Although the prospect might seem somewhat daunting or even terrifying for parents and caregivers, keeping young people safe can often be a compromise and a challenge.<\/p>\n<p>Your son or daughter may appear to be physically large and mature, but their emotional maturity and responsibility do not necessarily match this in behaviour. Most young people try to do the right thing most of the time, but your leadership as a caregiver is crucial. Ensure you are a good role model and discuss your personal views on drug and alcohol use. Your attitude towards addictive substances can have an enormous influence on the way your teenager approaches their use.<\/p>\n<p>Hosting a celebration at home or a venue for your teenager can be a fun and memorable event. It all comes down to careful planning. Agreeing on the ground rules before your event is announced is essential to ensure a clear understanding later. As the host, you owe your guests a \u2018duty of care and, therefore, should take all reasonable steps to ensure everyone attending the party is kept safe. Every party has the potential to get out of hand, as sometimes it\u2019s hard for young partygoers to make good decisions. Communication and regular discussions are vital because young people often face peer pressure to do things they prefer not to engage in.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.schooltv.me\/wellbeing_news\/special-report-guide-safe-partying\"><strong>&#8216;A Guide to Safe Partying\u2019 &#8211; READ HERE.<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I have mentioned this before however, I encourage you to have a conversation with your daughter\/s from year 7 up about the dangers of Vaping. We know this is happening at school but have not been able to speak to the young ladies who are doing it about the dangers of Vaping and the consequences of them being caught vaping at school.
