The purpose of the BRLA is to measure student learning of the content in the RE curriculum. Formal school and student reports are produced by the Office and will become available to schools in Term Four.\u00a0 The BRLA provides a \u2018point in time\u2019 snapshot of student performance in RE. Students\u2019 knowledge and understanding of the content of the RE curriculum is assessed using a combination of multiple choice, short and extended response items. Students\u2019 faith is not assessed. We wish all of our students well.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Library<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>In the Library we are excited to be planning for our annual Book Week activities; daily homeroom\/class quizzes, library display \u2013 items from the Academy of Taxidermy, design your own glasses at lunchtime, a scavenger hunt and the adopt a book returns.\u00a0 Plus this year we will also have a staff readathon, a photobooth based in the library (24<sup>th<\/sup> August), award winning author Amanda Betts working with our Year 11 students (25<sup>th<\/sup> August), the much anticipated Book Week Assembly and Dress Up and Parade (26<sup>th<\/sup> August) and finally Perform Education presenting to students in Years 3 \u2013 6 (29<sup>th<\/sup> August).\u00a0 The theme this year is \u2018Dreaming with eyes open\u2019 and we are definitely hoping to open every one\u2019s eyes to the magic of our library!<\/p>\n<p>Finally, we have launched our dance program for our littlest dancers \u2018Sparks\u2019, catering for students in Years 1 \u2013 2.\u00a0 The program is led each week by secondary students exploring a variety of genres, from jazz to lyrical to hip hop plus technique work.\u00a0 The enthusiasm of these dancers is second to none and they are setting the dance floor on fire.\u00a0 We can\u2019t wait to watch these dancers continue to grow and share their talents with our group.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19086\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Sparks-2-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Kind Regards,<\/p>\n<p>Mrs Janine Walsh<\/p>\n<p>Deputy Principal<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It was a fantastic end to the first semester at the College, with our Parent Teacher Interviews and the release of the College reports.\u00a0 Teachers appreciated the time to meet [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":20712,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"inline_featured_image":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[52],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.7 -
