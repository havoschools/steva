Over the Easter period we are reminded of the depths of your human suffering and the glory of your divinity. Your story breaks our hearts on Good Friday, but opens our hearts in joyous belief on Easter Sunday. May we, your Easter people, carry the joy of the Resurrection within us wherever we go. We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen<\/p>\n<p>The summit of our Liturgical Year is known as the Easter Triduum. These three liturgical services take place in our parishes over the Easter weekend. The first one is the Washing of the Feet on Holy Thursday, the second is the Lord\u2019s Passion on Good Friday and the third is the Mass of the Resurrection. Belief in the resurrection of Christ is the central tenet of Christianity. On earth, we are an Easter People who carry the joy of this event in our hearts wherever we go.<br \/>\nThe students of Year Six led us through the final day of Jesus\u2019 life on earth as a man. The Stations of the Cross are the events of Jesus\u2019 final day in which we take time to both recall and reflect. There are 14 Stations beginning with the story of the Last Supper and finishing with the resurrection of Jesus. The students of Year Six engaged our community in this mini pilgrimage in the College Gymnasium, preparing our hearts and minds for the feast of Easter.<\/p>\n<p>I encourage all families to engage with their parishes this Easter season and provide you with the Mass times for both Lesmurdie and Kalamunda Parishes where you will be very welcome.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Commencement of Term One Holidays<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-19\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/SON08517-198x300.png\" alt=\"St Brigid's College students with school principal\" width=\"198\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/SON08517-198x300.png 198w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/SON08517.png 290w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px\" \/><br \/>\nAs we commence our term one holiday break, I encourage all students to reflect on their progress during this first quarter of the year. Parent, Teacher, Student meetings and interim reports are a fabulous opportunity to review personal commitment and progress in all aspects of College life. I encourage all students to set new goals for term two.<br \/>\nShowing gratitude is proven to enhance wellbeing, however it is also received with warmth and appreciation. It also helps to build connections with other people. Don\u2019t forget to express thanks to your child for their achievements this term. Look for the positive impact they have made over the last 10 weeks, and be thankful for the wonderful child or young person that they are.<br \/>\nThere is an abundance to celebrate as a community. The incredible Year Seven students who commenced their secondary school journey with us in February are now confidently navigating lockers, classrooms and new expectations.<\/p>\n<p>Our boarding students who have transitioned from holiday freedom back to boarding school where routines and rituals govern all aspects of life should be commended. I am in awe of the independence of our wonderful three-year old\u2019s and kindergarten students who are learning within a play-based environment.<br \/>\nThank you to all parents who have engaged with St Brigid\u2019s this term. I continue to be in awe of the expertise within the St Brigid\u2019s community and thankful for the many conversations and generosity of time in building our wonderful Mercy College. I have enjoyed spending time with our Parent Representatives this term and look forward to hearing about the many opportunities that these individuals enable through their service to our College.<br \/>\nOur wonderful staff of St Brigid\u2019s continue to put the students in our care first, when making decisions. The staff of the College care deeply for your children and are fully committed to providing an environment whereby all can flourish.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Easter Bonnet Parade<\/strong><br \/>\nThe students of the primary engaged in the annual Easter Bonnet Parade as the final event of the term. Thank you to all families for investing time in preparing for this wonderful showcase of creativity. A great way to finish the term!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-21110\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2762-300x225.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2762-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2762-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2762-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2762-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2762-600x450.jpeg 600w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2762.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/> <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-21111\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2790-300x225.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2790-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2790-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2790-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2790-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2790-600x450.jpeg 600w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2790.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/> <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-21112\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2789-225x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2789-225x300.jpeg 225w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2789-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2789-300x400.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2789-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2789-600x800.jpeg 600w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2789.jpeg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-21113\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2792-300x225.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2792-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2792-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2792-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2792-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2792-600x450.jpeg 600w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/IMG_2792.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Term Two<\/strong><br \/>\nTerm two commences on Wednesday, 26th April.
