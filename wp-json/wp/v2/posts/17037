There was definitely a buzz as students rushed to grab a bargain of the latest Scholastic products and many compiling lists for consideration by their Grandparents at the annual Grandparent Day. From novels, to picture books, to novelty packs of books and the ever popular stationary collection, there was something for everyone. It was equally great to see some of our Secondary students visiting the fair and is an area we would like to grow in 2022.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17040\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Deputy-News.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1600\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Grandparent&#8217;s Day was a true celebration of community as students were able to tour their family through the building, playing a collection of &#8216;old fashioned games&#8217;, interviewing them about their life story, entering our newly assembled sensory room, taking time to go down the yellow brick road to read in our Oz inspired reading room. We are fortunate in the space we also hosted an interactive Science display and also a showcase of our robotics programme. We would like to thank our parent helper Sonya McGillivray for assisting us on the day.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">WACE exams have come to a close and we congratulate our girls on their efforts and we will now await their results. It has also been fantastic to receive ongoing notification of our students attaining their Certificate IVs, which have complimented their studies. Well done.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Booklists have now been published for 2022 on the College website <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/enrol\/essentials\/booklists\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/enrol\/essentials\/booklists\/<\/a><\/span> please refer to the site for all information regarding requirements.
