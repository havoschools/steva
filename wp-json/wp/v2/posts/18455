The timing was perfect with the easing of COVID-19 restrictions, which brought us together at the pool to cheer on our friends and our Houses.<\/p>\n<p>We also had the Mass for the year 3 in the church. It was amazing to watch the students sing and attend Mass with the parish community of Lesmurdie. Year 2 had their liturgy in the Wandju room. Mrs Cox, our Principal conducted the homily and vividly explained the meaning of Confirmation and the Holy Spirit.\u00a0 Parents and pupils stood in awe of the liturgy.\u00a0 We received a lot of compliments and positive praises that it was touching and beautiful.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-18456\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/DSC07826-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/> <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-18457\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/DSC07832-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We also commemorated Mother&#8217;s Day.\u00a0 Year 5 Green took the stage and honoured the mothers in their assembly.\u00a0 The students made us laugh and cry, speaking explicitly of their love and appreciation for their mothers who love them so much.\u00a0 After the gathering, we offered the parents delicious boxes of sweets.\u00a0 The beautiful boxes had been carefully and thoughtfully designed by our marvellous Community Relations and administration staff.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-18459\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/DSC06810-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/> <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-18460\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/DSC06811-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Students in Year 3 and Year 5 had their NAPLAN.\u00a0 There was no nervousness because students had the ability and knowledge to address the challenges they faced.<\/p>\n<p>In the last newsletter, I talked a little about the importance of cybersecurity. This term, we had a guest speaker, Paul Litherland who gave a good message about caution around the use of various social platforms.<\/p>\n<p>As usual, lots of learning is taking place on the primary campus.\u00a0 Grade 5 students are working on their robotics, and kindergartens are involved in their learning using play exploration. Year two used nature as a creative inspiration for their Mother&#8217;s Day cards. \u00a0Grade 6 pupils are busy working with Mrs Openshaw in the garden, growing potatoes.<\/p>\n<p>We were confronted with graffiti problems in the newly furnished boys&#8217; toilets.\u00a0 Students were guided to be proud of their school and the importance of keeping an eye on our environment.\u00a0 We also highlighted positive behaviours and congratulated the students when they displayed them.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0We saw students working to make sure that the school looked clean.\u00a0 They were magnificent demonstrations of pride and love for the college.\u00a0 It also coincided with Pope Francis\u2019 Laudato Si.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201c&#8230; We are called to be instruments of God our Father so that our planet might be what he desired when he created it and correspond with his plan for peace, beauty and fullness.\u201d LaudatoSi\u2019 n.53<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Prayer<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>God of creation,<\/p>\n<p>The earth is full of your goodness and beauty.<\/p>\n<p>Help us to hear the cry of the earth, so that we can fully understand how our decisions impact the environment.<\/p>\n<p>May we work to look after your incredible gift of creation.<\/p>\n<p>We make this prayer through Christ, our Lord.<\/p>\n<p>Amen.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Term 2 is very exciting as we engage in more activities and look forward to welcoming them enthusiastically.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>God Bless<\/p>\n<p>Anne Tan<\/p>\n<p>Head of Primary<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The first week we returned after our break, we had the swimming carnival.
