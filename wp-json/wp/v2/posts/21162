It was a privilege to be able to showcase our College and to share an insight into our beautiful community. Our guests were greeted by student leaders from the primary and secondary schools who exuded hospitality and pride<br \/>\nin their College.<br \/>\nThe meeting began with a prayer celebrating \u2018Light the Way\u2019, the words of which read by Mariah D\u2019Silva, Florence Clarke, Isabella Goodall, Teddy Sylwestrzak, Jaden O\u2019Brien<br \/>\nand Benjamin Olk, truly touched our guests. A variety of topics were discussed including cyber security and risk management. As they toured our College, our community<br \/>\nshared more of St Brigid\u2019s story with them.

The dancers have been working incredibly hard this<br \/>\npast term and, in a relatively short time, learnt a commercial jazz piece, choreographed by Emily Crockford an up and coming choreographer in Perth. We are proud to announce they placed First in their section and they lived up to their troupe\u2019s name as they were definitely \u2018on fire\u2019.<br \/>\nWe are looking forward to watching this troupe throughout the year. Huge congratulations dancers. I would also like to thank Ms Stephanie Oborne for leading this troupe and Mrs Maryanne Coote for assisting this past term behind the scenes.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-21165\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Untitled-design-2-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Untitled-design-2-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Untitled-design-2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Untitled-design-2-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Untitled-design-2-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Untitled-design-2-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Untitled-design-2-600x600.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Untitled-design-2-100x100.jpg 100w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Untitled-design-2.jpg 1890w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Year 7 Camp<\/strong><br \/>\nOur Year 7s headed off to Point Peron for three days and two nights. The focus of the Year 7 Camp was to provide students with the opportunity to challenge themselves and learn new skills by participating in a range of controlled, risk taking activities. Students were able to improve their leadership skills, build self-confidence, and develop their determination and a positive outlook in facing the challenges of starting Year 7. The students had a magnificent time, with activities including rock climbing, crate stacking (with Rielly setting a new Point Peron record of 20 crates), archery and team building activities. Of course, a Camp would not be complete without a movie night and the obligatory lollies! I am sure our Year 7s slept well on Thursday night along with our wonderful team of staff who accompanied them. We thank Ms Wicksey, Ms Casey, Ms Cahill, Ms Bianchini, Ms Benson-Lidholm, Miss Foster and Mrs Giovinazzo for their time and enthusiasm, spent with our students.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-21166\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Image-3-225x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Image-3-225x300.jpeg 225w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Image-3-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Image-3-300x400.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Image-3-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Image-3-1536x2048.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Image-3-600x800.jpeg 600w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Image-3-scaled.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/> <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-21167\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Image1-300x225.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Image1-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Image1-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Image1-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Image1-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Image1-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w, https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Image1-600x450.jpeg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Surf Online Safe \u2013 Years 4 to 12<\/strong><br \/>\nOur Years 4 to 12 students participated in a cyber safety session, led by Paul Litherland, who has extensive experience \u2018working at the coalface of online crime\u2019.
