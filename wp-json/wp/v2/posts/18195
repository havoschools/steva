The forty-day season of Lent begins on Ash Wednesday and concludes on Holy Thursday evening with the celebration of the Mass of the Lord\u2019s Supper. It is a time for Christians to commit to strengthening their faith through the three pillars of Lent: <em>prayer<\/em>,<em> fasting<\/em> and <em>almsgiving<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>SBC has raised vital funds regarding almsgiving via Project Compassion Boxes and the Easter Raffle. We are most grateful for the generosity of our College families, who supported and donated items for the raffle. All money raised will support projects coordinated by Caritas in Australia and neighbouring countries. We appreciate your support!<\/p>\n<h3><u>Stations of the Cross<\/u><\/h3>\n<p>We will conclude the term with a prayerful reflection on the Stations of the Cross led by our primary school students (live-streamed via Teams). We remember the path Jesus took on Good Friday. On the way to his death, Jesus showed us how to live and how to die. We cannot rise with Christ unless we walk the path with Him.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here but has risen.\u201d [Luke 24:5]<\/p>\n<p>Archbishop Timothy Costelloe SDB, in his Easter Message 2022, reminds us that the risen Jesus of Easter <em>\u201c\u2026enables us to be the instruments of healing, of hope and of new beginnings which we, our families, our communities, our country and our world so desperately need.\u201d <\/em><\/p>\n<p>Happy Easter to all SBC families!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Mr Adrian Martino<\/p>\n<p>Head of Faith &amp; Mission<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>LENT Most of this term has been spent in the Church season of Lent.
