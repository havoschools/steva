The girls look after each other as they would a sibling, with occasional arguments, but they eventually always make up and become friends again in no time. It is so lovely to watch the girls care for each, tell staff when they are worried about someone and generally be there for each other.\u00a0 This has been so important in what has been an interrupted and sometimes stressful term.<\/p>\n<p>[easy-image-collage id=18165]<\/p>\n<p>We have managed to do some activities out and around Perth, and though, at times, these have been limited, the girls have still had fun.\u00a0 We went to the beach, had ice-creams, visited the Kalamunda night markets, been shopping and visited the sculptures by the sea.\u00a0 There has also been plenty of weekend activities at boarding \u2013 including all things craft, making a Brownie in a mug, a movie night and finishing off the term with Karaoke.\u00a0 Thanks to all the regulars who participate, I encourage students to stay in occasionally on the weekend and join in on what is on offer.\u00a0 Hopefully, the variety of what we can do will open up more in Term Two.<\/p>\n<p>It has also been imposing watching the exercise and sports that many students are doing.\u00a0 When I get to boarding early in the morning, I am passed by students going for their morning run or going to the gym.\u00a0 Many in the afternoon visit the gym or the swimming pool.\u00a0 We also have girls participating in Basketball, horse riding, gymnastics, callisthenics, kickboxing and more.\u00a0 And once we get into Term Two, it feels like most of the Boarding House will be playing Netball, Hockey or Football.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cIn your brain, exercise stimulates chemicals that improve your mood and the parts of the brain responsible for memory and learning\u201d<\/em> (healthdirect.gov.au). If your daughter would benefit from more exercise or sport \u2013 please speak to a House Mum about what to get involved with.<\/p>\n<p>I hope you all have a lovely holiday together, and here\u2019s hoping to lessen restrictions and more fun for the girls in Term Two!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-18157 aligncenter\" style=\"color: #333333; font-style: normal; font-weight: 300;\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/off-to-do-some-shopping-300x147.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"447\" height=\"226\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Judith Cumpsty<\/p>\n<p>Head of Boarding<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Whilst Term One has offered many challenges for our Boarders and staff, it has also been a term with many highlights!
