Our Boarding students are back<br \/>\nand we have opened \u2018Mercy House\u2019 to accommodate our growing numbers. The first day for students was filled with mixed emotions. Some of our students wished the holidays were not over, whilst others were keen to get back into the school routine. The heart and soul of the school was back, and the usual hum of students and staff was music to my ears!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Professional Learning Day for Staff<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The staff of the College are a highly professional team who continually put the students first. Staff are keen to grow their capacity and seek out ways to further enhance their professional skills and<br \/>\nknowledge. Last Monday the staff gathered to discuss ways to enhance deep learning for all students. The discussions enabled all staff to build on their expertise, share some of their challenges and continue to support each other in the pursuit of academic excellence for all students. This keynote session was followed by some team meetings and compliance training. I applaud the staff for their commitment to our College mission of \u201cproviding excellence in education within a Christ centred environment\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ANZAC Day<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>During our Spirit of Mercy Assembly held on Wednesday, 26th April, I acknowledged the contribution of our Head Girls, Mackenzie Houlahan and Ella Giglia, at the Kalamunda ANZAC Day service hosted by the Kalamunda RSL. Mackenzie shared a little about what ANZAC Day meant to her. She stated that, \u201cAs a young person in today\u2019s world, ANZAC Day is not just about the past, it\u2019s also about the present and the future. As we remember those who have died, let us not forget those who came home and continued to suffer. Let us not forget the appalling costs of the war and all succeeding wars and conflicts in other countries. It is about recognising the ongoing sacrifices made by our current servicemen and women and the importance of supporting them and their families. As we gather to commemorate our fallen soldiers, we are reminded of the crucial importance of peace. We must work together to create a world where war is a thing of the past, and where we can all live in harmony and freedom and have hope for our future\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>I also wish to especially acknowledge Year 9 student Lillian Hales who is an army cadet within our community. Lillian assisted in the flag raising at the commemoration.<br \/>\nMany of our St Brigid\u2019s College students came along to honour the Service men and women who currently, or had previously served our Nation. I commend those students and their families in making this a priority on ANZAC day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Spirit of Mercy Award<\/strong><br \/>\nThe College held an Assembly on Wednesday morning to present the \u201cSpirit of Mercy\u201d Awards to recipients from last term. Each term, one student per year level is acknowledged for living the spirit of mercy within our community.<\/p>\n<p>Kindergarten Kai Griffin<br \/>\nPre-Primary Lachlan Restifo<br \/>\nYear One\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Isabella Goodall<br \/>\nYear Two\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Wynter Miller<br \/>\nYear Three\u00a0 \u00a0Vivienne Robinson<br \/>\nYear Four\u00a0 \u00a0 Mika Klaric<br \/>\nYear Five\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Indie Omodei<br \/>\nYear Six\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Jaden O\u2019Brien<br \/>\nYear Seven Emily Grabski<br \/>\nYear Eight\u00a0 Ella Evangelista-Comito<br \/>\nYear Nine\u00a0 Katie Otway<br \/>\nYear Ten\u00a0 \u00a0 Sophie Sayer<br \/>\nYear Eleven Kuliah Ryan<br \/>\nYear Twelve Alisha Sadler<\/p>\n<p>The Spirit of Mercy Award recognises students who consistently make a positive contribution to our school community and always give of their best to live our Mercy values of Compassion, Justice, Respect, Hospitality, Courage and Service.
