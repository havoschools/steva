This equates to two days per week.\u00a0 Students in Years 11 and 12 will be able to wear their sports uniform on Friday only.\u00a0 Please be advised that in terms 2 and 3, the full winter tracksuit will be required to be worn to and from school on designated days which will be advised early next year for year groups.<\/p>\n<p>In 2023, the students in Years 7 \u2013 12 will return to a vertical Home Room structure.\u00a0 This means the first 15 minutes of the day will comprise of a \u2018House\u2019 group of students representing all year groups.\u00a0 There are great benefits attached to this model for our community as our students collaborate with all year groups within the secondary environment.<\/p>\n<p>A Boarding House as a part of a school community provides a unique contribution.\u00a0 I marvel at the independence of our girls as they embrace the opportunities of education away from home.\u00a0 Many of our girls leave homes and properties where they have great responsibilities.\u00a0 They have a broad knowledge and expertise, and I enjoy learning more about their families and communities.\u00a0 The girls harness the opportunity here at the College to access a high-quality education.\u00a0 I applaud them for their commitment.<\/p>\n<p>The College has two collection bins in Student Services for any old stationery that your son or daughter would usually dispose of at the end of the year.\u00a0 Please consider putting these items in the collection bins as they can be recycled or repurposed.\u00a0 The group overseeing this is an organisation called, \u201cGive Write\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>St Brigid\u2019s College is truly fortunate to have minimal staff changes for 2023.\u00a0 I am thrilled that staffing has been finalised and we have an incredible range of expertise available to our students.\u00a0 I am aware that many staff are still struggling to fill positions in their schools.\u00a0 The great reputation of the St Brigid\u2019s College community attracts staff of outstanding calibre.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of this week, I will send home a final communication with all the essential details you will need in preparing for the 2023 Academic Year.\u00a0 I look forward to this final week with our students and thank all parents and caregivers for their support in partnering with St Brigid\u2019s College in 2022.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Veronica Parker<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Principal<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dear Families, As we approach the final week of the academic year, I ask that you take time to thank the staff of the College who have helped your son [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":20647,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"inline_featured_image":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[53],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.7 -
