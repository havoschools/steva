It is such a heart-warming time to see our young women confident in their achievements and looking forward to the next chapter of their lives.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We are blessed that our students were able to enjoy their final assemblies, House Breakfasts and traditional boater throw. The Graduation Mass, Presentation of Year 12 Awards and Dinner were enjoyed by all our Year 12 families. It was a full house with the many families and staff being able to attend. These many events take quite some organising, but our dedicated staff go out of their way to ensure that this is a special week in which the girls will add to their memories of school life. I spoke to the Year 12 students just before they left. As well as telling them how proud we are of them, I also reminded them to remember the importance of the people who they love in their lives. As they move on, I encouraged them to live the Gospel values and to be the wonderful young women that they are.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16858\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Term-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1600\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We were also able to celebrate and acknowledge the achievements of students at our Sportspersons Awards Evening and Presentation Night. To see our students stand proudly on the stage, and to view the talents of those who performed, is such a joy. As I regularly tell parents and students, we have a dedicated staff who continually work to give more and more to our students, but at the end of the day it is up to the student to take that advice and help, and to do the work. We congratulate all the students who were prize-winners, but we also congratulate all of our students who give of their best and achieve very good results. You should all be very proud.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As some of our Year 12 students prepare for the WACE examinations, the rest of our students are working diligently on their courses. Year 11 students will be the next group to sit examinations, with the Year 9\u2019s sitting examinations for the first time this year.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our Year 6 students are also busy preparing for the conclusion of their primary years, and the special activities organised for their end of year. In addition, there is a hive of activity in preparation for the Student Art Exhibition next Thursday at 6.00p.m. We look forward to having many of you join us for the evening.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Next week we farewell Mrs Geraldine Armstrong-Woods who is looking forward to semi-retirement. We thank her for her years of service, especially in the Arts area, and wish her well as she welcomes some time to spend on herself.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We look forward to having you join us next week at our College Fair on Saturday 6th November between 3.00p.m. and 7.00p.m. It promises to be a great afternoon with many fun activities.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We continue to pray to the Lord for the safekeeping of our students and their families.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">God Bless,<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Carmen Cox<br \/>\nPrincipal<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16876\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Fair.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1125\" height=\"1117\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Despite our unusually wintry weather, we have had a marvellous start to Term 4 and already the term has been jam-packed with activities.
