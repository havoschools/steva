The young ladies love going to Alfred&#8217;s Kitchen for burgers, visiting Krispy Cr\u00e8me for some yummy doughnuts, and San Churros. Exploring the scientific world at Scitech, watching the AFLW game, and a trip to Araluen enjoying the smells of the flowers. On top of all this, some of the young ladies went Roller Skating and a leisurely walk to Lesmurdie Falls.<\/p>\n<p>There will be more exciting things in Term Four when the weather warms up, and the sun comes out for a while.<\/p>\n<p>Our hockey team did not make it into the finals, but they tried valiantly. In many games, they were soaked to the skin whilst playing. Well done, ladies, for continuing to play and always having a smile on your faces.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of Week 7, the Year 10\/11\/12 Boarders Ball, in conjunction with our brother school, Mazenod, was held in our SBC Gym. Approximately 80 students had a lovely time. All dressed up beautifully for their special night. Special thanks to our Head Boarders, Bridie D&#8217;Alton and Selena Thompson, plus Kyra Clayton and Madison Hall for their organizational skills and setting up on the night. Also, the volunteers their time to help out.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19723\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Boarders-Ball.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"788\" height=\"591\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe that our Year 12&#8217;s have started their final days and are getting ready to graduate. The Boarding community said farewell to the Year Twelves with a High Tea at Lavender Bistro and Boutique in Caversham. Following tradition, the Year eleven&#8217;s put together a night to &#8220;Farewell to Year 12&#8217;s&#8221;, where they proudly displayed some information that the Year Twelve parents\/guardians shared with the Boarding Mums. Let&#8217;s say there was a lot of laughing and happy tears.<\/p>\n<p>Congratulations to our 2023 Head Boarders Alisha Sadler and Kiera Watts and the councillors Cameron Loton and Juliet Nixon.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19720\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/2023-Leaders.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"739\" height=\"554\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We look forward to seeing all the Boarders back for Term Four on Monday 10th October from 3 pm, ready to start school on Tuesday the 11th.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Kind regards,<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Fiona Hepi, Donna Gill and Lynn-Maree Byrne<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As another term comes to a close, the girls are excited about going home to some much warmer weather than we have been having in Perth.
