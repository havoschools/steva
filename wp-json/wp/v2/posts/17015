As they prepared for their leadership speeches, you could feel a strong rattle of excitement in the Year 5 classes. They sought advice and asked questions from current leaders to better understand what being a good leader entails. It was lovely to see the passing of information between the two year groups.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our leadership candidates were exceptional. Their speeches were polished and well-researched. In addition, they spoke clearly and all had a personalised message that was mature and well-structured. We are proud of every student that ran for the leadership and house leaders\u2019 positions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17019\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Year-6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1600\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17020\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Year-6a.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1600\" \/><br \/>\nWhile the Year 5s were working on their leadership speeches, the Year 6s prepared for their Shark Tank presentation. I had the opportunity to have a sneak preview of some of their great inventions. I am certain that lots of hard work and research went in to getting these done. The students will be presenting their pitch and trying to convince a group of professionals to invest in their products and services. I have been fortunate to be part of the professional panel and cannot wait to have a first-hand look at their innovation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17018\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Shark.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1600\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not to outdo the older students, the Pre -Primary children have been working on their mathematics, including high-levelled addition. We were also fortunate to have the Year 10s visit the Kindergarten, students and together, they worked on some painting.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the fields of the Arts, we had a wonderful evening viewing the creative art pieces and paintings from our young talented girls and boys at the Student Art Exhibition. Many of them also took away prizes for their visual art pieces. At the Twilight Fair, our talented choirs sang to kick start the biennial event. Many watched and were in awe of the harmonies and the beautiful singing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17016\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Art.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1600\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The recent Grandparents\u2019 Day was a spectacular one too, with over 900 visitors to our school. The children had immense fun and showed their grandparents the activities, crafts and learning they had been working on throughout the year.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17017\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/GP-Day.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1600\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our nature playground is starting to take shape. The students will get a chance to play on the new playground before school finishes for the year.<\/p>\n<p>Students from Year 3 to Year 6 also voted for their student leaders for next year.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17064\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Photo25-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Don\u2019t forget that our in-term swimming will commence next week. Furthermore, the students are also preparing for the traditional Christmas Carols on the Green. Our Pre-Primary children have also been rehearsing for their nativity assembly.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is our primary campus, where the activities for fun and learning never cease.<br \/>\nWe look forward to seeing you at our forthcoming events.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">God Bless<br \/>\nAnne Tan<br \/>\nHead of Primary<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There is never a dull moment on the primary campus.
