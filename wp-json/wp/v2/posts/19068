We started the celebrations with a smoking ceremony performed by Ms Grace Comeagain, the Welcome to Country was performed by Mr James Kearing where he explained to the students about Wadjuk Noogna country. We were blessed to have the Binar Dancers come and do some dancers for the students and getting some of the students to join them on stage for one of the dances.<\/p>\n<h4><\/h4>\n<h4><strong>SchoolTV<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>This week on SchoolTv we are looking at Understanding Adolescence<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cParenting adolescents can be demanding, terrifying, exhausting and a sanity threatening endeavour. Often it can be a lonely business with many parents being afraid to share their concerns.\u201d<\/em> Dr Michael Carr-Gregg<\/p>\n<p>Overview of this edition<\/p>\n<p>Adolescence is a significant developmental stage marking the transition from childhood to adulthood. It is characterised by an emerging sense of self-identity, exploration of personal interests, beliefs, values and goals, increased independence and autonomy beyond the family, growing responsibility, increased engagement in risk behaviours, emerging sexuality, amplified significance of peers, intensification of gender stereotypes, and shifting relationships with parents and caregivers. Adolescents seek increased independence and autonomy, which requires ongoing negotiation and compromise within the parent-child relationship.<\/p>\n<p>To read more and hear what some professionals are saying click <a href=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.schooltv.me\/newsletter\/understanding-adolescence\">HERE<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It was great to see our young ladies in year eleven and the young gentlemen from Mazenod join teams for the Year Eleven Quiz Night held at in the Staffroom at the College. Competition between the tables was energetic and the Bamboozled Quizmaster did a fantastic job controlling the crowd.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Year 10 Drama<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>The Year 10 Drama ladies invited their parents and staff to watch what they have been learning in their Drama class. It was a wonderful evening seeing the girls perform and make the audience members laugh. The girls showed a lot of talent and some of them I am sure will go further than the SBC PA room.<\/p>\n<p>A friendly reminder is required about the winter uniform and jewellery. The winter uniform for year 7 -11 young ladies is the tartan skirt closer to the middle of their knees than their thighs. The lemon blouse with the college tie. Blouse top button done up and the tie tied correctly hiding the top button. The college green jumper and the blazer. Sometimes it can be rather cold at school so we encourage the young ladies to wear a skivvy under their lemon blouse. They have a choice of either wearing the green socks or black stockings. However, when your daughter is representing the College and on photo days (August 15 &amp; 16) she needs to wear the stockings. The Year 12s wear everything the same except their blouse is white.<\/p>\n<p>The young ladies are allowed to wear two matching plain earrings in their ear lobes and no other piercings while at school. We do ask for your support with this matter as more and more students are trying to break the rules and they are receiving lunchtime detentions. If they receive three lunchtime detention they then need to complete an after-school detention and they lose their Good Standing. All of this is located in your daughter\u2019s College Organiser.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>Mrs Fiona Hepi<\/p>\n<p><strong>Head of Secondary<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have started Term Tree off with a bang by celebrating NAIDOC.
