Where has this year gone? We started 2021 a week later due to COVID, but thankfully, we managed to complete the year successfully. Parents, you should be very proud of your daughter\/s for all they have achieved in 2021. Yes, there were a couple of rough patches for some of the girls, but being brave young women, they came through it all developing some new coping skills that will assist them in the future.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Year 9s had their lawn bowls social last week, and according to one student, it was fun, especially when they played against the teachers and won. They liked that it was quite a relaxing atmosphere and that it was something different that they wouldn\u2019t normally do \u2013 some liked the fact that there were no boys there! From all accounts, it was an enjoyable and relaxing evening, even if it was a little cold.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thank you to Mazenod for hosting the Year 7 Hawaiian dance social. The evening was very \u201ctropical\u201d with Hawaiian shirts worn by the students. The girls enjoyed the opportunity to either dance by themselves or with a partner. Another great evening had by all, including the staff who danced the night away as well.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Year 8s invited parents to come and see some fantastic Science experiments based on material they had learnt throughout 2021. The young ladies had come up with a range of experiments, from making ice cream and setting it without a freezer to elephant toothpaste, the best bath bombs and rainbow fire.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-17161 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Year-8.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1600\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Year 7s invited their parents to come and see what inventions they had created to help sustain the environment. These ranged from upcycling clothes into dog toys to cleaning the ocean and an app that tells you what foods have palm oil in them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17160\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Year-7.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1600\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Activities Day gave all the Years 7 \u2013 9 girls the opportunity to celebrate their year of learning and attend activities at different venues. The Year 7s went to Latitude, the Year 8s went ice-skating, and the Year 9s had a wet obstacle course set up on the Senior Oval. We finished the year off with our final assembly where the College Assistant Leaders for 2022 were announced. Charli Vinci &#8211; Ministry, Missy Armstrong &#8211; Cultural, Rose Considine &#8211; Sports and Nichola Powell &#8211; Sustainability.

It is important to outline the rules and boundaries around age-appropriate alcohol consumption and its legal implications.<\/p>\n<p>Young people are at greater risk of alcohol-related harm than adults because their brains continue to develop until their mid-twenties. The safest level of alcohol consumption for teenagers is no alcohol at all, but this may be difficult to enforce and may not prevent them from experimenting. However, parents and carers can influence sensible drinking habits and help minimise the risks.<\/p>\n<p>In this Special Report, a series of discussion points are offered to help make the conversation about alcohol consumption a little easier. We hope you take time to reflect on the information provided in this Special Report, and as always, we welcome your feedback. This SchoolTv information can be found by clicking here.<\/p>\n<p>If you do have any concerns about the wellbeing of your child, don&#8217;t hesitate to get in touch with the school for further information or seek medical or professional <a href=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.schooltv.me\/wellbeing_news\/special-report-having-alcohol-discussion-au\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">help<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I would like to take this time to thank you for your ongoing support, as I have always said, it is a partnership between parents and the school when it comes to the education of young minds.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To the families who are leaving the College at the end of the year, we wish you all of the best and remember you will always be part of the SBC community.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wishing you all a safe Christmas and a Happy New Year.
