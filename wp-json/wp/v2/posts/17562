I want to pass on my thoughts to all of the boarding families whose recent fires have impacted several areas and floods in other parts of the state. While COVID is certainly providing its challenges, our thoughts and best wishes are with our families in these affected areas.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to the Parent Forum, St Brigid\u2019s is part of SchoolTv, and throughout the year, we will be posting links that are relevant to your daughters and sons.

It was a beautiful morning with special guests joining the 90+ students and us from the graduation class of 2021.<\/p>\n<p>2022 started with all things going ahead; however, due to COVID-19, we have had to change the way we do things. The first thing we changed was how we ran our House Assembly. The House Coordinators set up a Team invite to their Homeroom Teachers. The House Coordinators announced the year 8 -11 House Reps, and the Homeroom teacher presented them with their badge. Some of the reps are shown below<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17564\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/60.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"952\" height=\"713\" \/><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17568\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/50.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"618\" height=\"464\" \/><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17567\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/40.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"826\" height=\"619\" \/><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17566\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/30.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"749\" height=\"562\" \/><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17565\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/70.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1191\" height=\"893\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We as a College have had to change or postpone the swimming carnival, year seven camp, and the year eight teamwork\u2019s day. The SRC Leaders had to think outside the box to present their introductory assembly. This year the leaders broke up into their individuals\u2019 teams, filmed their section sent it to the Head Girls, who created an iMovie and streamed it to the year 7 -12 students.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Every year staff at the college run learning area clubs that provide extra support to the young ladies, some of these are not running. However, the year sevens will have the Homework Helper club running in the Year Seven block Monday afternoons from 3:30 &#8211; 4:30.<\/p>\n<p>Just a couple of friendly reminders with regards to the young ladies at SBC:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mobile phones must be locked in your daughter\u2019s locked locker from 8:35-3:20 (they can use it to pay for items from the canteen). Smart Watches switched to flight zone.<\/li>\n<li>All students come to school wearing their full summer uniform, including their boater. They are provided time to change into their PE uniform<\/li>\n<li>Any Year 12 who is driving to school must have completed the drive to school form and return it to student Reception (forms can be collected from Mrs Cumpsty\u2019s office).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Fiona Hepi<\/p>\n<p>Head of Secondary<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hello Everyone, I would like to take this opportunity to commend all of the young ladies on such a positive return to school and welcome all of our new ladies [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":20785,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"inline_featured_image":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[42],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.7 -
