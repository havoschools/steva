I thank you all for your support and understanding. Our Leadership Team members are now experts in contact tracing, reporting to the Health Department, and managing the ever-changing conditions that have been updated nearly every second day. Further, our staff are having to cope with the change to numbers in their classrooms, whilst having to cater to all the needs of students forced into isolation. Our numbers have continued to increase, but we are managing the situation well. I thank the many of you out there who have acknowledged the wonderful work our staff are doing for the care, health and education of our students.<\/p>\n<p>As I write to you, we are aware of, but not yet officially informed of, new community requirements and changes to school restrictions. I am sure that like us, you are all keen for our students to once more be involved in extra-curricular activities that are normally on offer. As restrictions ease and we have the official \u2018go ahead\u2019 from the Department of Health, these activities will be reintroduced.<\/p>\n<p>We were thrilled to be able to offer our students their \u2018Fun Day\u2019 as a respite from their daily classroom work. Our thanks are extended to Ms Hepi and our Student Leaders for their comprehensive planning, ensuring that all activities complied with COVD-19 guidelines. That was no mean feat, but it was a joy to see the students letting off steam in a fun, safe way.<\/p>\n<p>Staff have spent recent weeks finalising the Term 1 Interim Reports which have now been made available via SEQTA. Families would also have received information regarding the Parent \/ Teacher \/ Student Interviews. These interviews will be conducted via TEAMs video conferencing, and I encourage you to take the opportunity to discuss your child\u2019s progress with the teachers.<\/p>\n<p>Over this last month or so, we have been changing our Internet and Phone platform. Unfortunately, this has disrupted our phone and email facilities at various times. We are hopeful that the process is now complete and the \u2018bugs\u2019 have been sorted. Thank you for your patience as I know how frustrating it can be when ease of communication is interrupted.<\/p>\n<p>Attached to this eNews is a Fact Sheet from the Australian Government regarding vaccinations for students aged 5 to 11. Whilst Australia\u2019s coverage rates are high by international standards, it is important for us to share this information with you so that our children can be kept as safe as possible.<\/p>\n<p>During the remaining days of this term, we are looking forward to our Spirit of Mercy Assembly and the Stations of the Cross. Our fundraising has focussed on Project Compassion and I encourage you to talk to your children about the important work Caritas does. I am also hopeful that you will be able to help your child support this very worth cause, either via the Easter raffle or the Project Compassion boxes in each classroom.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-18199 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/DSC02561-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/><\/p>\n<p>School recommences for students on Tuesday, 26th April. Students are to return in their winter uniforms. We ask you to spend some time over the coming holiday to ensure that your child\u2019s winter uniform is in good order. Uniform Shop hours are available on the College website.<\/p>\n<p>ANZAC Day falls within the school holiday break, so the College will acknowledge this special day during the last week of this term.<\/p>\n<p>As we near Easter Sunday when our Lord is risen, may we remember Jesus\u2019 sacrifice and give thanks for what He has brought to our world. May we feel the warm embrace of God\u2019s love at this special time and may the glory of Jesus\u2019 resurrection remind us that, with God, nothing is impossible or without hope.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>God Bless,<\/p>\n<p>Carmen Cox<\/p>\n<p>Principal<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Since our last eNews, we have certainly seen many changes as COVID-19 finally arrived in our community.
