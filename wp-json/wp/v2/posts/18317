To complete the Juris Doctor is an accomplishment, and she has done it outstandingly by being in the top 15% of the cohort. The Dean\u2019s List recognises those students who have achieved this honour and those who have completed Advanced Legal Research by Invitation and, therefore, have demonstrated the ability to undertake sustained and independent legal research of the highest calibre.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Amy was ranked 7th in the 2021 cohort of 138 students and will be formalised at the 2021 Awards Ceremony later this year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Check out a short interview we did with Amy:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How does it feel to accomplish an achievement like this?<\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0<\/span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Have you always wanted this?<\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0I never thought of starting a law degree and finishing on the Dean\u2019s List, but it feels fantastic for all my hard work to have paid off!<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Were there times that you found it challenging to push yourself? What motivated you to keep going?\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Law is notoriously hard going and stressful at times, but I had a great support group of other law students to keep me motivated. It helps that I am incredibly passionate about the law and genuinely interested in it.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What is your next move?<\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0I currently work at the Court of Appeal as a Judge\u2019s Associate. Next year, I hope to move into either criminal or family law and be a judge myself or run my practice one day.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Any word of advice for the St Brigid\u2019s girls?<\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0Be authentic and support one another \u2013 the only way we progress as women and society are through collective strength. You can never go wrong working hard and pursuing what you are passionate about.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What an inspiration! Once again, congratulations, Amy!
