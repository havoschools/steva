I enjoyed celebrating this beautiful and festive day with you for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>This term I have been thrilled with the commitment of students in maintaining high standards in uniform and grooming. I extend my thanks for the strong partnership that exists with parents in supporting staff in keeping the St Brigid\u2019s standards high.\u00a0 I am very proud of our students and encourage them to continue to wear their uniform with pride from the moment they leave home in the morning, to their arrival back home at the end of the day.<\/p>\n<p>At St Brigid\u2019s we recognise, and are sympathetic to those students impacted by illness or poor health.\u00a0 This is, of course, a valid reason for reduced attendance.\u00a0 As partners with parents, however, it is important to point out that reduced attendance has a significant impact on academic learning.<\/p>\n<p>As travel is now on the radar for many families, I reiterate the importance of planning holidays within the school holiday breaks. Families who choose to take holidays during the term are required to complete an Application for Extended Leave form located on the College\u2019s website.\u00a0 Family holidays taken during term time for recreational purposes, are not endorsed by the College and documented as unapproved leave on our absentee register.<\/p>\n<p>In order to access the full curriculum and give students the best chance of success, Catholic Education Western Australia recommends the rate of 90% &#8211; 100% as \u2018<em>Regular Attendance<\/em>\u2019.\u00a0 When attendance falls below this level, it indicates a student may be at risk of not reaching their full potential.\u00a0 The chart below gives a breakdown of the amount of time missed in a year, and if maintained, how it impacts on the future education of the child:<\/p>\n<table width=\"601\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"179\"><strong>Period of Absence<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>(Year 1 \u2013 10)<\/strong><\/td>\n<td width=\"121\"><strong>Rate of Attendance<\/strong><\/td>\n<td width=\"119\"><strong>Equivalent School Missed over 10 years<\/strong><\/td>\n<td width=\"181\"><strong>Level of educational risk<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"179\">Average of 5 days per term<\/td>\n<td width=\"121\">90%<\/td>\n<td width=\"119\">1 Year<\/td>\n<td width=\"181\">Classified as regular attendance<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"179\">1 Day per Week<\/td>\n<td width=\"121\">80%<\/td>\n<td width=\"119\">2 Years<\/td>\n<td width=\"181\">Indicated at Risk<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"179\">1.5 Days per Week<\/td>\n<td width=\"121\">70%<\/td>\n<td width=\"119\">3 Years<\/td>\n<td width=\"181\">Moderate Risk<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"179\">2 Days per Week<\/td>\n<td width=\"121\">60%<\/td>\n<td width=\"119\">4 Years<\/td>\n<td width=\"181\">Moderate Risk<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"179\">3 Days per Week<\/td>\n<td width=\"121\">50%<\/td>\n<td width=\"119\">5 Years<\/td>\n<td width=\"181\">Severe Risk<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>The St Brigid\u2019s College community has celebrated many events and has showcased some great learning throughout the term.\u00a0 \u00a0I applaud all students who have engaged in learning as well as the broader life of the College.\u00a0 We aspire that St Brigid\u2019s is an extension of family and through participation in the life of the College, students build a stronger sense of belonging.<\/p>\n<p>[easy-image-collage id=19667]<\/p>\n<p>Our Year 12 students are close to the completion of their studies and I know that they are filled with mixed emotions as they prepare to take their next logical step beyond St Brigid\u2019s.\u00a0 We will honour them in our customary farewells as a community early next term.<\/p>\n<p>On behalf of our community, I extend my thanks to all staff for their work this term.\u00a0 The biggest impact on learning is the teacher and we are grateful to have such proficient staff working together in teams to support our students.<\/p>\n<p>I wish all members of our community a wonderful holiday break.\u00a0 I know that our Boarding girls will be thrilled to be home for a couple of weeks, engaging in some quality family time.\u00a0 I encourage all families to spend some time in recreation together.<\/p>\n<p>Our Team Leader Property and Works, Mr Jason Forde, has resigned and whilst we are saddened to hear of his departure, we congratulate him on his appointment to Clontarf Aboriginal College where he continues in a similar role.\u00a0 We thank Jason for his dedication and commitment to our community over the last 3 years.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Please do not hesitate to speak with me if you have any concerns or queries.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Kind regards,<\/p>\n<p><strong>Veronica Parker<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Principal<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dear Families and Friends of St Brigid\u2019s College, In conjunction with the Feast Day of Our Lady of Mercy, St Brigid&#8217;s College celebrated our Mercy Day with a Mass with [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":287,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"inline_featured_image":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[53],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.7 -
