The beautiful surroundings are a wonderful reminder that our God delights in the celebration of the wonderful gifts we have to offer our school community at the start of a new year. Our theme focused on the Mercy Values of courage and justice, highlighted in the Gospel story of Luke 6:27-31. Father Michael McMahon OSM was our celebrant and we also welcomed a number of the Sisters of Mercy, Ms Mary Retel (Mercy Education Limited Board Director) and College Advisory Council Members.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Ash Wednesday Liturgy<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Due to COVID-19 restrictions, we will be celebrating Ash Wednesday, 3 March, in our individual classes or Homerooms. Ash Wednesday begins our forty-day season of Lent that leads to Easter. On Ash Wednesday, we come together like the people of the Old Testament to remind ourselves that we do not always follow God\u2019s ways and that we need to ask for God\u2019s mercy and forgiveness. Like God\u2019s people in the time of the prophets, we wear ashes to show that we want to turn away from whatever keeps us from God and to have a change of heart so that we can live in peace and in joy with God and with each other.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-17508\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/pjimage-11-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"387\" height=\"232\" \/><br \/>\n<strong><u>Fast &amp; Abstinence during Lent<\/u><\/strong><br \/>\nThe Church season of Lent begins on Wednesday, 2 March with Ash Wednesday. The \u00a0College community will participate in an Ash Wednesday prayer service via Teams.<br \/>\nLent is a penitential season of prayer, self-denial and helping others. In this way, the whole Church prepares for Easter, the major Christian liturgical feast of the year.<br \/>\n<em>Ash Wednesday <\/em>and <em>Good Friday<\/em> are days of <strong>fast<\/strong> (one main meal) and <strong>abstinence <\/strong>(no meat). The law of <em>fasting<\/em> binds those who have completed their eighteenth year, until the beginning of their sixtieth year; the law of <em>abstinence<\/em> binds those who have completed their fourteenth year (Code of Canon Law 97, 1251-52). As a result, the canteen will not be serving meat products on Ash Wednesday.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Sacramental Programme<\/u><\/strong><br \/>\nParents in Years 3, 4 and 6 are reminded to carefully read the information provided by Barbara Bolding (Our Lady of Lourdes Sacramental Program Coordinator) if you would like your child to receive the Sacraments at Our Lady of Lourdes Parish.
