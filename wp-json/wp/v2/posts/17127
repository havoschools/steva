I would like to congratulate our Kindergarten students on completing their first year at St Brigid&#8217;s. How lucky are we to have such enthusiastic and kind hearted students beginning their schooling with us. I know I have enjoyed chatting with them each Friday when they come into the Library, each proudly sharing their weekly borrowings with me; they know they have been my favourite class!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our Year 9 students completed their first set of exams this past week, as part of transitioning into the more senior years and to have an opportunity to show themselves how much they have learnt this past year. They are to be commended on their approach to their studies. Our Certificate III Education Support students have been busy completing their work placements at a variety of early childhood centres and the feedback has been outstanding regarding their contributions, skill set and approach to the placement. We are very proud.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We also were excited to welcome our new students (and boarding families) to the College at the Orientation Day, we are very much looking forward to all of these students next year! Finally we are proud to announce our first Flexitrack High cohort in 2022, who have all been successful in gaining a position in Murdoch&#8217;s University preparation course, which will be delivered at St Brigid&#8217;s plus these students will also complete various courses at school with the goal of entering Murdoch University in the course of their choosing the following year. We are very much looking forward to watching their progress.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-17132\" src=\"https:\/\/sbcl.wa.edu.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/DP-Table-1024x241.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"151\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our teaching staff have been equally busy in preparing the final Academic Reports for the year, which compliments progress which has been shared throughout the year via SEQTA and assessment pieces sent home. Reports are intended to be released to parents of Pre-primary to Year 10 students on the 9th December. Year 11 Reports should have already been accessed by students and their families on the 2nd December.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A reminder that Booklists are available to be accessed on the College webpage.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thank you to all families for your incredible support over the course of the year and we look forward to doing it all again in the new year.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">God bless and have a safe and Holy Christmas<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Janine Walsh<br \/>\nDeputy Principal<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I would like to extend congratulations to all students for such a successful end to the 2021 Academic year.
